# Spicy Topping - UTMT Room Loader

This repository contains most of the code present in Spicy Topping for loading CYOP levels.
The code is mostly based on [Mitchell1711's CYOP fork](https://github.com/Mitchell1711/pt-cyop), albeit "rewritten" to be more inline with my coding style.  
Since the code uses a few functions or things that are specific to Spicy Topping, if you want to use this yourself you'll have to edit the code a bit.  
Feel free to do whatever with it.

# rm_cyoplevel

There are a few mentions of this room in the code.  
It's just an empty room with a gray background that contains an instance of obj_CYOPLoader in it.
